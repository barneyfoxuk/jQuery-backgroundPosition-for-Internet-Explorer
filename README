Description:
Internet Explorer uses backgrounPositionX and backgroundPositionY as opposed to backgroundPosition.
This fixes the support of backgroundPosition with the jQuery css method in IE.

Usage:
You can continue to use backgroundPosition like always, this just normalizes the property for IE.

Note:
Keep the comment with the code please, thanks!
